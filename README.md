### [Experimental] Multilocale Duplicate Slug

Allow duplicate slugs for post translations when using the [Multilocale](http://google.com) plugin.  
**Experimental** means currently probably nothing ☠️ works and looks as expected yet, this is meant for personal pleasure 🚬.

Hat tip: Heavily ~~ripped from~~ based on the [Polylang Slug](https://github.com/grappler/polylang-slug) plugin by [@grappler](https://github.com/grappler), 🙏 muchas graçias!
